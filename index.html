                I am JD. At least that is what they call me at work. I am a <inline class="calc-age">99</inline> year-old software developer 
                for the Native American Tulalip Tribes of Washington. Most of the time I spend hours online, developing webtools for them
                8 hours a day, 5 days a week.
                <br/><br/>
                Most of the time I am having fun, solving problems and doing all the good stuff. but other times I am thinking about what else
                I can do. whether it be making javascript widgets, like the ones I will make here, or its how I can advance my indie game development.
                <br/><br/>
                I am apart of a <a href="http://www.lostseraph.com">small indie game company</a> as well! we develop games for mobile phones and would really appreciate additional feedback, 
                as we have a unique art style and I am still perfecting my implementation approaches.
                <br/><br/>
                I also have a developer page but haven't looked at it in a while so don't look to far into that one...
